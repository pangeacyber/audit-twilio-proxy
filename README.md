# Pangea SMS Secure Audit Log Example

An SMS forwarding service that logs messages between two parties in real-time using Pangea's ![Secure Audit Log Service](https://pangea.cloud/services/audit-log/). By publishing conversation hashes to the blockchain you can provide irrefutable evidence of what was said between two parties without actually exposing the contents of the conversation publicly. With Pangeaâ€™s ![Secure Audit Log SDK](https://pangea.cloud/docs/sdk/java/audit/#log-an-entry), you can deliver the power of the blockchain to your users with a few lines of code.
